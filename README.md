# Fireship.io

Content [designed](https://fireship.io/mission/) to increase developer happiness üòÅ and productivity üöÄ.

## Project Tour

The monorepo is organized into four sub-projects. 

1. `hugo` - Static Site Generator. This is where the content lives. 
2. `design` - Theme & CSS
3. `components` - Angular Elements Web Components
4. `functions` - Firebase Cloud Functions Serverless Backend

## Running the Site


First, install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

```shell
git clone <fireship-repo>

npm install

npm run dev
```

Visit `localhost:1313` and you should be live. You do not need the web components for general content development, but they can be built with:

```shell
cd components && npm install
npm run build
```

## Contributing

Edit and fix the site's content in `hugo/content/`. Feel free to submit PRs for small issues. For large issues or features open an issue first. 

First, fork this repo on Github.

```
git clone <your-forked-repo>
npm install
npm run dev

git checkout -b my-fix
# fix some code...

git commit -m "fix: corrected a typo"
git push origin my-fix
```

Lastly, open a pull request on Github. Once merged, your changes will automatically be deployed to the live site via the CI/CD pipeline.
