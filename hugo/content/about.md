## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who Are You?

[Jeff Delaney](/contributors/jeff-delaney)

### How did you build this Web App?

With JavaScript of course. More specifically, the UI mostly relies on Web
Components via Angular Elements. User auth and all backend cloud resources
are handled by Firebase. The static HTML and content is managed with Hugo
- it's the JAM Stack on steroids.

### What Tools do you Use?

I built my computer with my bare hands and mostly write code with VS Code on Ubuntu. I produce videos with Adobe Premiere and AfterEffects. I create graphics with Figma.
